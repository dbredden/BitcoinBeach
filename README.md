# BitcoinBeach

A booking platform for vacation properties in El Salvador. This Web MVC is built on 3 MSSQL data tables (Units, Customers, and Reservations). 

This was built with C# and the .NET Framework and MVC5. 

A hypothetical travel agent can use this application to create a record of customers (renters) or landlords who own the properties for the use of renting. 

This tool can also be used to store and track reservations in the future to ensure that units don't get double booked on the same date. 

Additionally, this can be used to store unit information such as price (in Bitcoin) per night, maximum guests allowed, bed count, and bathroom count. 

# Steps to Use

1. Register for an account
2. Use the navigation bar to go to the desired section (Accounts, Units, Reservations) to input the information you are ready to add.
